For completeness, this directory contains various programs used for generating various tables in HyperRogue.

* Quotient space tables (in `hrmap_quotient` in `cell.cpp`) have been generated with `bring.cpp`, `schmutz.cpp`, `quartic.cpp`, `macbeath.cpp`, and (for Minimal) manually.

* Pattern rules (in `patterns.cpp`) have been generated with patterngen.cpp.

* Precomputed windmaps (`windcodes*` in `complex.cpp`) have been generated by the disabled code in `windmap::create()`.

* Embedded font (`fonttable` in `nofont.cpp`) has been generated with `-DCAP_CREATEFONT=1`.

* Vector graphics (`polydata[]` in `polygons.cpp`) have been generated in the Vector Graphics Editor. Press the Shift+S to generate the data in the required format. (Replace `ID` with `NEWSHAPE, id`.)

Some of these programs are standalone, while some need to be compiled with HyperRogue. These programs are not maintained (they are written once and forgotten), so (in the latter case)
it is likely that they do no longer work; however, they are still included for reference.
